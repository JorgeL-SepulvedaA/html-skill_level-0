HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. In here, there's a couple of HTML files for showing how it works; each of them is loaded with css/bootstrap in order to not to be just text in a page. Hope you like it.

Finally, for you to understand how all the pages/files works, yo umust follow the upper NAV, if exist, or just read the whole page and push every single button, depending the case, for you to get the actual page you'd like to go to instead.
